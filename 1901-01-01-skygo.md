Sky Go is the first product I worked on at Sky. When I joined the project, it was behind on deadlines and not working very well. After just a few months, my team and I managed to improve the application's rating from 2 to 4.5 stars. We updated the app with some of the latest iOS features and dynamic layouts. This product was later decommissioned and the functionality put into the codebase of Sky Q as part of a huge internationalisation and code sharing project.
