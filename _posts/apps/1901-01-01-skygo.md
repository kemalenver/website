Sky Go is the first product I worked on at Sky.  When I joined the project it was behind on deadlines and not working very well.  After some months of work my team and I managed to improve the application rating from 2 to 4.5 stars.  We updated the app with some of the latest iOS features and dynamic layouts.  Later on this product was decommissioned and the functionality put in to the code base of Sky Q as part of a huge project of internationalisation and code sharing.
