Stern is a German news and current affairs application. My task was to take a legacy backend system and make the data available for consumption on multiple platforms. My team and I took the legacy formats, converted and normalised the data to JSON and then created iOS and Android applications to consume that data. It was an ambitious project, but one I am very proud of as it was regularly featured on the App Store and is the top news application in Germany. Further work involved creating multiple applications from the same codebase (Gala and Brigitte), but with various designs and features that were feature flagged in the code. The apps built with this codebase have around 5 million users. We were able to release regular updates every 2 weeks.
