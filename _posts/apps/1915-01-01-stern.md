Stern is a German news and current affairs application.  My task on this application was to take a legacy backend system and make the data available to consume on multiple platforms.  As part of this my team and I took the legacy formats, converted and normalised the data to JSON and then created an iOS and Android application to consume that data.  It was a very ambitious project but one I am very proud of as it was regularly featured and in the top news applications in Germany.  Further work involved creating multiple applications from the same code base (Gala and Brigitte), but with various designs and features that were feature flagged in the code.  Overall the apps built with this codebase have around 5 million users.  We were able to push out (and I believe still can) push out regular updates every 2 weeks.
