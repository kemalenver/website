Der Tagesspiegal is the most popular newspaper in Munich. They were looking to put their content onto mobile and so we built this application. When iOS 4 was released with the newsstand feature, we were the only newspaper in Germany to launch with it, which won us an accolade from Apple who boosted it to a featured application. We were the top news application in Germany at the time. The circulation of the paper increased massively thanks to this application and is a good example of how traditional industries can become even more successful by adapting to new innovations.
