Planetary was first released in 2011 by bloom.io - it visualises an Apple Music library as a galaxy.  It was later acquired by the Cooper Hewitt museum, but for the past 7 years it remained dead - until I fixed it.  I'm currently collaborating with the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian museum in New York to maintain it.  See my blog for more information!
