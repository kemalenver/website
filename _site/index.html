            <p><p>Sky Go is the first product I worked on at Sky.  When I joined the project it was behind on deadlines and not working very well.  After some months of work my team and I managed to improve the application rating from 2 to 4.5 stars.  We updated the app with some of the latest iOS features and dynamic layouts.  Later on this product was decommissioned and the functionality put in to the code base of Sky Q as part of a huge project of internationalisation and code sharing.</p>

            <p><p>Sky Q is Sky’s flagship application for consuming TV and movies on the go.  It is a companion application for the Sky Q set top box, and interfaces with it directly over sockets and a set top box API.  Part of my work at Sky was preparing the code base of this application to be used across multiple territories.  This also involved merging the code bases of Sky Go in to this project.  It was a very ambitious undertaking with very tight deadlines which we managed to meet.</p>

Part of my work on NOW TV was to incorporate other modules I had written for Sky’s other products, such as the media player and the VAST / VMAP compliant advertising implementation that I wrote.</p>

            <p><p>Stern is a German news and current affairs application.  My task on this application was to take a legacy backend system and make the data available to consume on multiple platforms.  As part of this my team and I took the legacy formats, converted and normalised the data to JSON and then created an iOS and Android application to consume that data.  It was a very ambitious project but one I am very proud of as it was regularly featured and in the top news applications in Germany.  Further work involved creating multiple applications from the same code base (Gala and Brigitte), but with various designs and features that were feature flagged in the code.  Overall the apps built with this codebase have around 5 million users.  We were able to push out (and I believe still can) push out regular updates every 2 weeks.</p>

            <p><p>Gala is a German celebrity news and entertainment application.  It was built in a similar way to Stern, but the entire project had to be updated to be configurable.  This application was also featured and in the top lists of the App Store.</p>

            <p><p>Brigitte is a German women’s magazine.  It was built in a similar way to Gala, and was the third application built on the same project codebase of Stern.  This application was also featured and in the top lists of the App Store.</p>

            <p><p>Maxdome is a video on demand application from Pro Sieben in Germany.  It was a very interesting project to do as I worked with web developers to create a hybrid web technology / native application.  Most of the UI was done with the web technologies, but all of the DRM and video playback and account management was done natively.  We built an in-app API that allowed these layers to work together seamlessly.</p>

            <p><p>Der Tagesspiegal is the most popular newspaper in Munich.  They were looking to put their content on to mobile and so we built this application.  When iOS 4 came out with newsstand we were the only newspaper in Germany to launch with this feature, which won us an accolade from Apple and featured application.  We were also the top news application in Germany.  The circulation of the paper increased massively thanks to this application and is a good example of how traditional industries can become even more successful and adapt to new innovations.</p>
