Sky Q is Skyâ€™s flagship application for consuming TV and movies on the go. It is a companion application for the Sky Q set top box, and interfaces with it directly over sockets and a set top box API. Part of my work at Sky was preparing the code base of this application to be used across multiple territories. This also involved merging the codebases of Sky Go into this project. It was a very ambitious undertaking with tight deadlines which we managed to meet.
